# Contributing to Ellis App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ellis! This app helps service providers better serve marginalized communities through relationship management, service referrals, and care coordination.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Expo CLI** - Install globally with `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- **Git** for version control

For mobile development, you'll also need:
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development - macOS only)

### First-Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Add the original repository as upstream**
4. **Navigate to the App directory and install dependencies**
5. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `App` directory
   - Contact the maintainers for the required Supabase credentials:
     ```
     AUTH_SUPABASE_URL=your_auth_supabase_url
     AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_auth_supabase_anon_key
     DATA_SUPABASE_URL=your_data_supabase_url
     DATA_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_data_supabase_anon_key
     ```
6. **Start the development server**

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start Working

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Follow the existing code structure**:
   - Place new screens in the appropriate directory under `screens/`
   - Add shared components to `shared/`
   - Use the established naming conventions
   - Follow the modular approach outlined in the project structure

2. **Test your changes**:
   - Test on both iOS and Android if possible
   - Ensure the app builds without errors
   - Test with different user roles (service providers, clients)

3. **Follow coding standards**:
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Follow React Native best practices
